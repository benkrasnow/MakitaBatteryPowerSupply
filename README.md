# MakitaBatteryPowerSupply
3D printed shell for Makita LXT battery and variable power supply
I've had a similar one of these portable power supplies for a while, and have found it surprisingly useful around the shop.

Parts needed:

Banana plug binding posts -- https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07D6KDWYP

Power supply -- https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZSGKTX5

Makita battery adapter -- https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086S47GZG

3D printed case (STL, STEP, and Fusion360 files provided in this repo)

I had to pop apart the battery adapter from Amazon, cut a hole in the blue part, and reroute some smaller wires through the hole instead of routing them out the side as in the original adapter.  I tried to find open-source CAD for the adapter, and was not able to find it, so am just using the part from Amazon for now.
